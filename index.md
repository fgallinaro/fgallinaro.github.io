<h1>Francesco Gallinaro's personal webpage</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Francesco Gallinaro, a postdoc in the Logic group at the University of Freiburg.</p>
<p>This is my webpage and as of today (14/10/2022) it is as you can see under construction. Hopefully in a few days it will be a bit more lively! </p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can find some information about my research <a href="https://fgallinaro.github.io/research">here</a> and a way to contact me <a href="https://fgallinaro.github.io/contact">here</a>.</p>
