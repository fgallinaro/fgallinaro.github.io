<h1>Francesco Gallinaro's personal webpage</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Francesco Gallinaro, a postdoc in the Logic group at the University of Freiburg.</p>
<p>This is my webpage and as of today (14/10/2022) it is as you can see under construction. Hopefully in a few days it will be a bit more lively! </p>
<p> Meanwhile, you can have a look at the links below. </p>
