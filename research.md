<h1>Research</h1>
<h2>What is it about?</h2>
<p> The focus of most of my research is the model theory of fields. Usually (but not always) this means exponential fields or valued fields.</p>	
<p> On the side of exponential fields I am mostly interested in Zilber's conjectures predicting that the complex exponential field is <i>quasiminimal</i> and <i>exponentially-algebraically closed</i>. </p>
<p> On the side of valued fields, I am interested in the connections between model theory and tropical geometry. </p>

<h2> PhD Thesis </h2>

<p>I wrote my PhD thesis, "<a href="https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/31077/">Around Exponential-Algebraic Closedness</a>", between 2018 and 2022 at the <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/"> University of Leeds</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4058/dr-vincenzo-l-mantova">Vincenzo Mantova</a>. It is about, well, Exponential-Algebraic Closedness, and it contains roughly the same things as papers 1, 3, and 5 listed above (although I would recommend looking at the papers), together with a general introduction to the problem and some of the further directions of research that I cared about as of April 2022.</p>
